customer churn prediction using deep learning

Churn prediction means detecting which customers are likely to leave a service or to cancel a subscription to a service. It is a critical prediction for many businesses
because acquiring new clients often costs more than retaining existing ones. Once you can identify those customers that are at risk of cancelling, you should know
exactly what marketing action to take for each individual customer to maximise the chances that the customer will remain.
